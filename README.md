### 2. Project Objective

To build and evaluate machine learning models for diabetes prediction using two datasets:

The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

An extended diabetes dataset with features like age, gender, BMI, and HbA1c levels.

This project demonstrates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

### 3. Project Workflow

**Step 1: Data Collection and Exploration**

Datasets:

Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset: https://github.com/TasneimAhmed/diabetes-classification/blob/main/notebook%20and%20data/first_data/diabetes.csv 

Extended Diabetes Dataset: Contains additional features like lifestyle factors and medical history. https://github.com/TasneimAhmed/diabetes-classification/blob/main/notebook%20and%20data/second_data/diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv 

Key Tasks:

Visualize data distributions (e.g., histograms and box plots).

Identify missing values and handle them appropriately.

Compute correlations between features using a heatmap.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

Normalize continuous features (e.g., glucose levels, BMI).

One-hot encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, smoking status).

Handle missing values using imputation methods:

Mean/median for numerical features.

Mode for categorical features.

Apply SMOTE or other techniques for class balancing if necessary.

Split datasets into training and validation sets (80:20 ratio).

**Step 3: Model Training**

Train multiple machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting 

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Shallow Neural Network

Use grid search or random search for hyperparameter tuning.

**Step 4: Model Evaluation**

Evaluate models using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

**Generate:**

Confusion matrices for model performance visualization.

**Step 5: Cross-Dataset Generalization**

Train models on one dataset and evaluate on the other to test generalizability.

Fine-tune models based on performance.

**Step 6: Insights and Visualization**

Feature importance analysis 

Visualize relationships between features and predictions (e.g., partial dependence plots).
